3. My goal to is get more experience and knowledge regarding web development in a competitive environment.
I founda myself in a situation where I had to decide if i want to continue my career in medicine or not.
I decided to pivot into a new career and started to learn web development by myself.
The process is hard but rewarding and looking back at myself I can tell how far I have come, even though it is only a start of the road.
4. Knowledge of HTML, CSS and SASS/SCSS, good JavaScript foundation, comfortable with React, Node, Express and MondoDB.
5. I am building an application that I plan to use for recording my applications and analyze them for better future outcomes of
applications/ interviews.
